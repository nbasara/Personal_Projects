List.java Lex.java ListClient.java Makefile README


The List file is used to construct the linked list.
It points forwards and backwards so that you may 
move in both directions.  There are some general 
functions that can be performed on this linked list
in order to change the contents.

Lex acts the main function for this programming 
assignment.  It opens a file to read its contents,
places that contents into an array.  we use functions
from List to create a list of indicies that will indirectly
sort the array. At no point is the array sorted.  Instead
the array is placed by calling upon the LinkedList of 
indicies for the array.  The array is thus placed
in alphabetical order in a second file.

ListClient is a basic tester for our list class 
and README acts as a compiler and dedicates a 
main class.
