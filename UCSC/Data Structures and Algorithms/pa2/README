I was unable to completely flesh out the bugs within my program.  I completed 
ListClient and are able to sort files to a given amount.  I was not capable of
finding the source of this bug.  

List.c - creates a doubly linked list that can be manipulated Lex.c and ListClient.C
List.h - declares all functions created in List.c
Lex.c - opens an input file and reads each individual charcter until "\n" is seen.
        These characters are placed into a temporary array while compared with past 
        lines in a two dimensional array.  The two dimensional array is sorted by
        indeces from a linked list.  Once everyline is read and sorted, it gets printed
        onto the output file.
Makefile -  creates an executable for Lex.c and ListClient.c
