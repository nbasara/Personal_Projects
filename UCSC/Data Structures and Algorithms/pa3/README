List.java Matrix,java Sparse.java ListTest.java MatrixTest.java Makefile README


The List file is used to construct the linked list.
It points forwards and backwards so that you may 
move in both directions.  There are some general 
functions that can be performed on this linked list
in order to change the contents.

Matrix creates an array of linked lists.  It then
calls on functions within List to contruct and
alter the matrix.

Sparse acts the main function for this programming 
assignment.  It opens a file to read its contents,
places that contents into the desired matrix.  It
then performs the desired function on both matrices
and writes on the output file.

ListTest is a basic tester for our list class 
and Makefile acts as a compiler and dedicates a 
main class.

MatrixTest is a basic testing class that I used
to see if my functions were working as desired.
