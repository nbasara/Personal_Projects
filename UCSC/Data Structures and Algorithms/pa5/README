The List file is used to construct the linked list.
It points forwards and backwards so that you may 
move in both directions.  There are some general 
functions that can be performed on this linked list
in order to change the contents.

Graph creates an array of linked lists, and multiple arrays to assist 
with DFS.  It then calls on functions within List to contruct and
alter the graph.

FindComponents takes an input file and constructs our 
graph using Graph.C.  Given our graph we run
DFS on the graph then on its transpose. Once DFS is run on the
transpose the ascending finish times are strongly connected
components.

GraphTest is a basic test to test the functions within graph.
