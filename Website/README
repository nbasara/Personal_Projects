Never built a website before so I thought it would be time to start one.  

The main idea will to build a personal portfolio of sorts.  A place to congregate all past and future work for people to explore.  It will work as good practice and something that I will actually be able to use in the future.

For now Hello World HTML with have to do.

For reference I am using code academies web app tutorial for this stuff.
